## About

This website is my personal project, developed to help my mom in her business. It's my first "big" project and i keep studying and working on this,
upgrading the code everyday.

### Functionalities
The website is an institutional website. Was made to spread the business, like a visit card. The brand is new and it has your focus on delivery, having your top sale on deliveries app. There is a form in the contact page, some explanation about the company and a nice UI Design.
